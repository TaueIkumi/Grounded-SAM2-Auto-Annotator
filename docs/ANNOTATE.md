# ANNOTATE BY CVAT

This guide explains how to import annotations automatically generated by Grounded-SAM 2 into CVAT (Computer Vision Annotation Tool) so you can review and correct them in a web browser.

## CVAT server setup

Start a CVAT server to manage annotations.

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cvat-ai/cvat
cd cvat
```

### Set environment variables
```bash
export CVAT_HOST="localhost"
export CVAT_VERSION="v2.12.0"
```

### Build and start
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Create a user account
Create a user that the upload script will use:
```bash
# enter the docker container first
docker exec -it cvat_server /bin/bash
# then run
python3 ~/manage.py createsuperuser
exit
```

## Grounded-SAM 2 environment

Set up the environment that generates the annotations (Grounded-SAM 2). See INSTALL.md for detailed instructions.

## Run the upload script
Use the provided Python script to transfer a local dataset to CVAT:
```bash
python -m src.annotate \
  -u "http://localhost:8080" \
  -U "admin" \
  -P "admin-pass" \
  --format your-format \
  --dataset-dir DATASET-dir/ \
  --task-name "test_project_v1"
```

## Working in CVAT
1. Access: Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080/tasks`.
2. Select the task: Click Open on the task created (the one named with `--task-name`).
3. Start a job: Click the job link in the Jobs list at the bottom to open the editor.
4. Edit: Adjust AI-generated boxes with the mouse, remove false positives, and correct labels as needed.
5. Save: Click the Save icon (or press Ctrl+S) to store your changes.
